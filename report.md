> We didn’t set out trying to prove anything, but rather compile real data. We framed it as a census rather than a study. So we Googled our way to 8,000 screenplays and matched each character’s lines to an actor. From there, we compiled the number of words spoken by male and female characters across roughly 2,000 films, arguably the largest undertaking of script analysis, ever.

The dot graph titled "2,000 Screenplays: Dialogue Broken Down by Gender" visually represents the distribution of dialogue between men and women in a sample of 2,000 screenplays in [Hollywood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood). The graph employs blue dots to depict male characters and red dots to depict female characters. The data in the plot unmistakably indicates that men have a higher frequency of speaking roles within these works, as a considerable number of screenplays exhibit a greater proportion of male characters speaking compared to female characters.

This gender analysis of Hollywood film dialogue graphically provides compelling evidence of men's domination in terms of dialogue distribution. The graph emphasizes the significant disparity between male and female character dialogue, highlighting the prevalent imbalance in gender representation within screenplays. These findings shed light on the ongoing gender inequities in the film industry and call for a more inclusive and balanced approach to storytelling.
